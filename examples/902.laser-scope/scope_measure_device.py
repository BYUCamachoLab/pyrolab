class WavelengthAnalyzer:
    """
    Uses a trigger signal to convert datasets from time-domain to wavelength.

    Correlates a trigger signal, typically output from a laser, to a dataset.
    The laser logs the current wavelength each time the trigger is high.
    The trigger signal is expected to be a single channel of data as acquired
    by a data acquisition device. The wavelength sweep rate may not be constant
    or linear in time. After receiving trigger data and the corresponding
    wavelengths, a curve is fit to the wavelength as a function of time.
    Wavelengths for the raw data is then calculated by sampling the curve at
    the same time points as the raw data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_rate : float
        The sample rate of the acquired data. Sample rate of the trigger signal
        should be the same as the sample rate of the raw data.
    trigger_data : ndarray
        The collected trigger signal. A peak finding algorithm is used to
        correlate time points to the wavelength log.
    wavelength_log : ndarray
        Log of wavelengths for each time the trigger signal was high.
