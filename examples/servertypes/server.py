Server Types Demonstration
--------------------------

Runs a class as either threaded or multiplexed, based on user input.

1. ``thread`` A single object is created but different proxies can call
   its functions simultaneously from different threads.
2. ``multiplex`` Only a single instance exists and it cannot be called from
   different threads; each call arriving is placed in a queue and executed
   sequentially.
