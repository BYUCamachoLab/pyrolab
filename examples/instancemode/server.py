Instance Mode Server
--------------------

Registers the same class, SampleService, with the nameserver in three 
different modes:

1. ``single`` A single instance is created and all calls, across proxies, 
   access the same object.
2. ``session`` An instance is created per incoming Proxy connection. Until
   the connection is closed, the same instance is used. Simultaneous Proxies
   get their own instance.
3. ``percall`` An instance is created for each call, even if it's from the 
   same Proxy connection.
