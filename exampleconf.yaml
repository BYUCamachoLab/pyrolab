# This is the format of a PyroLab configuration file.

# You can use this file as a template and make modifications for
# specific PyroLab settings. By default, PyroLab uses a file in
# the program's .config directory. Replacing that file will load
# your custom settings automatically on startup (regardless of
# whether or not you're using a virtual environment!).
# However, settings can easily be reset to defaults in the code
# by using the command `pyrolab.config.reset(use_file=False)`.
