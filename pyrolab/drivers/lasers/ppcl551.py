    Driver for a Pure Photonic PPCL551 series laser.

    The laser must already be physically powered and connected to a USB port
    of some host computer, whether that be a local machine or one hosted by 
    a PyroLab server. Methods such as :py:func:`on` and :py:func:`off` will 
    simply turn the laser diode on and off, not the laser itself.
