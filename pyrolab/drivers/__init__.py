class Instrument(Service):
    """
    Abstract base class provides a common interface for services and instruments.

    While not a true abstract base class (it *can* be instantiated), all the
    essential functions raise NotImplementedErrors when run. They are therefore
    required to be overridden by derived classes.

    Note that, in order to support autoconnect within the PyroLab framework,
    the ``__init__`` method is never used to set up or connect to the 
    instrument. This is because when objects are hosted by a PyroLab server,
    they are instantiated and that object exists in perpetuity. Since we'd like
    to be able to connect and disconnect from devices while leaving the server
    running (an example use case would be to use the device locally, in a lab,
    manipulating physical controls, without killing the server connection), 
    separate methods ``connect()`` and ``close()`` are required. In this way,
    instruments can be forcibly disconnected without leaving the hosting
    object in an unrecoverable state.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _autoconnect_params : dict
        A private dictionary of parameters that will be used to connect to the
        instrument when hosted by a PyroLab server. This value should never be
        manipulated by a user. It is listed here to prevent accidental
        overwriting by an unwitting user wanting to use the same name.

        Returns a list of connection parameters for available devices.
        
        Static function that can be called without object instantiation.
        Returns all available devices that can be detected on the local
        computer. Each available devices is represented by a dictionary that 
        could be passed directly to :py:func:`connect` using dictionary 
        unpacking.

        Returns
        -------
        List[Dict[str, Any]]
            Each list item represents a unique device. The dictionary is the
            keyword arguments passed to ``connect()``. If devices cannot be
            detected, this should return an empty list.

        Examples
        --------

        >>> device = Instrument()
        >>> device.connect(**available[0])

        Connects to instruments or services that require initialization. 
        
        All parameters must be keyword arguments; the presence of any 
        positional arguments will break the functionality of ``autoconnect()``.

        The base class implements parameters as a keyword argument dictionary.
        Derived classes may declare explicit parameter lists, but all 
        arguments are required to be keyword arguments, i.e. parameters 
        with default values. Default values do not necessarily need to be
        sensible; for example, a default value of None for some required
        parameter. The code should then raise a ValueError for missing
        parameters. The dictionary construct must be used because the 
        autoconnect functionality delivers values to this function as an 
        unpacked dictionary.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kwargs : dict
            A dictionary of parameters required for connection and setup.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if connection was successful, False otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If the derived class does not implement this method.

        simply calls :py:func:`connect` with the saved parameters.
