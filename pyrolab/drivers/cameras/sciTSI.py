Thorlabs Scientific Camera
==========================

Driver for a Thorlabs Scientific Camera.

.. attention::

   Presently Windows only. 
   
   Requires ThorCam software. Download it at `thorlabs.com`_.

   .. _thorlabs.com: https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=ThorCam

   Potential future Linux support, since ThorLabs does provide a Windows and 
   Linux SDK.

.. admonition:: Dependencies
