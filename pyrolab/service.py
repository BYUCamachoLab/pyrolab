class Service:
    """
    Abstract base class provides a common interface for services and instruments.

    Not a true abstract base class, but adds some necessary and convenient 
    functions inherited by any class that would like to be a PyroLab service.
    """
    @classmethod
    def set_behavior(cls, instance_mode: str="session", instance_creator: Optional[Callable]=None) -> None:
        """
        Sets the Pyro5 behavior for the class (modified in place).
        
        Equivalent to using the ``behavior`` decorator on the class, but can 
        be used dynamically during runtime. Services that specify some default
        behavior in the source code can be overridden using this function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance_mode : str
            One of "session", "single", or "percall" (see manual for differences).
        instance_creator : callable
            A callable that creates a new instance of the class (see manual for
            more details).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``instance_mode`` is not one of "session", "single", or "percall".
        TypeError
            If ``instance_mode`` is not a string or ``instance_creator`` is 
            defined but is not callable.
