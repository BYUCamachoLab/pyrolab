Summary
=======

Congratulations! You've successfully: 

* set up a PyroLab network on your own computer, 
* launched the PyroLab monitoring daemon, 
* registered a service, 
* connected to that service, and 
* interacted with it using a Proxy client!

The User Guide contains some advanced tips and tricks, but for the general
user of PyroLab, you now know enough to set up your own functioning network
and use the included drivers for controlling hardware. 

As you create your own generic drivers, we'd love for you to share them with us
to be included in core PyroLab. See the `Contributing
<development_contributing>`_ page for more information.

We'd love to get your feedback to make PyroLab better. Issues and feature
requests can be made through our `Issue Tracker
<https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab/pyrolab/issues>`_.
