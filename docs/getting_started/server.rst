Server (and Service) Configuration
==================================

While servers, their associated daemons, and services registered through them
can be thought about and developed separately, in deployment, their
configurations are inextricably linked. Hence this section will again reference
services, in addition to servers.

Server and service configurations are only important for host machines
providing services to a PyroLab network. For a client simply connecting to the
network to utilize available PyroLab services, there is no need to configure
servers or services.
