## 0.3.0 - 2023-02-26

Major restructuring, bug fixes, new features!

### Added
- There's a new Flask web app called pyromonitor that can be configured to
  ping a nameserver and present instrument status in an easy-to-read table.

### Changed
- Fixed connection function for PPCL55x lasers so they don't alternate between
  connecting and failing if they're already connected.
- All PyroLab errors now subclass Pyro5 errors in an attempt to make them
  serializable over the network. This way, more useful information appears
  on the client side than "unsupported serialized class."

### Removed
- None
