## 0.3.0 - 2023-02-26

Significant restructuring, bug fixes, new features!

### Added
- There's a new Flask web app called pyromonitor that can be configured to
  ping a nameserver and present instrument status in an easy-to-read table.
- PyroLab now pings PyPI to check for updates and notifies the user if a newer
  version is available.

### Changed
- Fixed connection function for PPCL55x lasers so they don't alternate between
  connecting and failing if they're already connected.
- All PyroLab errors are now builtin Python errors in an attempt to make them
  serializable over the network. This way, more useful information appears
  on the client side than "unsupported serialized class."
- Configuration files are now stored in the same directory as the PyroLab
  package installation. This means that when it's uninstalled, it doesn't 
  orphan configuration files in some obscure directory on your computer.

### Removed
- None
