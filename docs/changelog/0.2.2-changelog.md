## 0.2.2 - 2022-05-16

Minor updates and bug fixes.

### Added
- Logging implementation is now multiprocessing safe (each process logs to its
  own file) and doesn't throw errors by trying to access the same file. The
  CLI combines the logs from all processes into a single output file.
- Added fallback for autoconnect to several devices; if host machine is already
  connected, don't try to connect again!

### Changed
- RTO scope documentation fixed and added to.
- TSL550 laser power limits updated.
- Bugfix for pathlib library for Python 3.7.
- Fixed device unlocking bug.

### Removed
- None
