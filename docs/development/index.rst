PyroLab was developed by `CamachoLab at Brigham Young University <https://camacholab.byu.edu/>`_ but also
strives to be an open-source project that welcomes the efforts of volunteers. 
If there is anything you feel can be improved, functionally or in our documentation,
we welcome your feedback -- let us know what the problem is or open a pull
request with a fix!

More information about the development of PyroLab can be found at our 
`project webpage <https://camacholab.byu.edu/research/computational-photonics>`__.
