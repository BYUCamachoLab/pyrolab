Docstring Standards
-------------------

This project strictly adheres to the numpydoc style guide.

Type Hinting
------------

We type hint all our functions and classes. This includes parameters, return
values, and some constants if it contributes to code clarity.

The numpydoc parser used to generate the documentation is clever enough to
remove the type hinting from the documentation, yielding clean looking 
documentation as well as clear code. The best of both worlds!
