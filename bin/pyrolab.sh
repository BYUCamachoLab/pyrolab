Startup Script
==============

An example daemon autolaunch configuration for *nix machines.


First, configure PyroLab by running the following command:

    pyrolab config update <config-file>.yaml

Then, a file similar to this one will act as your startup script. 
Be sure to give it executable permissions before registering it with crontab:

    chmod +x pyrolab.sh

You'll want to register it with crontab by running:
    
        crontab -e
    
Then, add the following line to your crontab file:

    @reboot /path/to/pyrolab.sh

The rest of this script assumes you're using Anaconda (or miniconda) and
have a Python 3.7+ environment named 'pyrolab'.
"""

source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate pyro
pyrolab up --force
